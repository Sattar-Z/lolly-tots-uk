                  We take the privacy of children very seriously. Any personal
                  information collected about the children in our care, such as
                  names, birth dates, or medical information, is handled with
                  the highest level of confidentiality and used only for
                  purposes directly related to their care and education.

                  safe, secure, and private environment for all children at our
                  nursery.
